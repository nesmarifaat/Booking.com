## Introduction


These scripts leverage Selenium WebDriver to interact with the Booking.com website, simulating user actions such as:
* **Searching for accommodations:** Automating the process of entering destination, dates, and guest information.
* **Viewing property details:** Accessing information about specific hotels or apartments.
* **Simulating booking flows:** Demonstrating the steps involved in making a reservation (without actually completing the booking).


This project utilizes Cucumber to define acceptance tests for the OrangeHRM system's functionalities. These tests ensure that the system behaves as expected and meets the requirements outlined for each feature.

The provided URL (https://www.booking.com/) appears to be a demo Home page for an Booking system. It's likely that this project interacts with this demo site in order to test Booking functionalities.
